The only reason to use google drive link is because, there are too many small project files(around 20-25k files)


The size of project files is -257mb
The size of apk is- 25 mb


This link contains 2 folders:


1) New Unity Project --> It contains it's Project files


2) Built             --> contain CubeDash apk and it's Assembly code

->download the CubeDash and play the game


->To use the project download the New Unity Project folder and locate it in Unity Engine

#Note


-> Currently shop is not working.


-> I have used Non-copyright material including the background music
